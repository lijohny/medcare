# **App Name**: MediHome Navbar

## Core Features:

- Logo Display: Display the MediHome logo (icon and text) on the left side of the navbar.
- Navigation Links: Include navigation links: Home, Services, Our Team, and Contact, aligned to the right of the navbar.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the navbar is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, maintaining consistent layout and usability.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light gray (#F9FAFB) for a clean, modern background.  Based on the image, a desaturated color that conveys a sense of cleanliness and medical professionalism seems appropriate. The analogous accent reinforces a sense of reassurance.
- Accent color: Soft blue (#63B3ED) for the logo, providing a calm and trustworthy feel.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for navigation links and the company name. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use flexbox to align logo to the left and navigation links to the right.
- Ensure links are evenly spaced.
